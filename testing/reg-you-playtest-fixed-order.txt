## reg-you-playtest-fixed-order.txt

## Failures for the Saavedra problem game, but without test-commands to force certain endings.
## The point is to make sure there's a way through. In the initial release, there was not, due to a one-line bug.
## This doesn't cover all combinations, but it does cover one, given a fixed ordering of game-states.
## Also, some flee squares are forced with the RFA command, which checks to make sure the flee type is unchanged.
## The KXR comments are there to notify you that the enemy rook gave a spite check.
## This could be changed later, e.g. once the rook gives a spite check and you take it, remove it from the list possible achievements. But it stays, now.
