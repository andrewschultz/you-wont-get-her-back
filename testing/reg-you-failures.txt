"Back and forth, eh? One more time here and we can call this dumb war off. No winners, no losers. Them's the rules."
The black rook slides north to d6, putting you in check.
"Well, if you repeat, I can repeat, too. Not much else to do, right?"

The black rook slides south to d5, putting you in check.

!The black rook slides north to d6, putting you in check.
"REPETITION OF MOVES!" the enemy rook calls out. They're right. It's odd--the whole affair seemed a draw, anyway, so why were they so eager to claim one? I guess they are eager to get back to oppressing pawns, or something.
DEBUG: checking for threefold achievement.
Congratulations! You just got the THREEFOLD achievement!

Triumph! The pawn makes it to the eighth rank. It's too good to be true! Your queen is back. Surely she will be able to outmaneuver a mere rook?

Your wife swoops in and gives the enemy rook a good what-for. But there's a problem! The enemy king can't move anywhere! By some really awful ancient rules of war, this is not on. Stalemate, it's called. All the fighting is for naught. You're forced to resign your royal title because, apparently, you didn't do things right.
They claim you could've avoided it. But what is the right way, then?

And so it comes to pass: the enemy king, safe from the main action for so long, is trapped. He thought he was safe or, if you got close, he could get out of the corner quickly enough. Even being one square away from the corner would've been good enough! Well, he deserved his fate. You can't remember how or why he got there. You have your revenge, which is something, even if you will have to do without your queen.
It's been a long fight. You don't even remember why it started. But with your rook beside you, you will restore the kingdom, slowly but surely.

The black rook and king breathe a collective sigh of relief as the black rook begins checking you vertically. You'll never be able to stay on a3 and b3 to keep the enemy king boxed in. It's going to be a draw. A long, fifty-move one, unless you agree to trade rooks. But even getting into position for that may be tiresome.

Your rook looks dismayed. The black rook seems surprised. "Take him and get it over with! I'm tired of this stupid war!" the king booms from the corner. The black rook and your rook protest. They'd like a good, long, boring draw, but your opposite number doesn't have time for that. The black rook sighs and does its duty.
All that work, and nothing to show for it all around. At least you are able to take the enemy rook back to force a draw.

Of course, you could have had your rook do the taking. But you had a bit of unfinished business. You needed someone to beat up after being forced to get your rook and not your wife back. Your own rook understands, of course. The enemy king is forced out of the corner momentarily until you stuff him back in. It's a nice bit of petty revenge, especially since it doesn't get in the way of winning the war.
