TRADED PAWN: letting the rook sacrifice itself for your pawn
Instead of writing lots of lines with dashes, I'll mention there are nineteen achievements below the trickiest you've found.

Once you've won the main game, you will unlock different final enemy moves, each of which allows an achievement or achievements unique to it. There are eight hidden, but the other fifteen are achievable. You've gotten one of them so far.
