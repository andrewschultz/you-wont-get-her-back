You haven't found any achievements, but don't worry. You'll get one soon. [this-game] tracks both wins and losses. You'll find creative losses as you go.

The black rook slides over to c5, keeping an eye on the pawn, which can easily be taken before it is promoted. Of course, the enemy king has no shot of corralling the pawn so the rook doesn't die in the process. Your hopes of winning are dashed!

The rook zips down to d1. So unfair! You have feet and legs and everything, and you're nowhere near that fast! But you see what's up. You'll be able to guard your pawn easily. Thankfully, the enemy king's too far away to gang up on your pawn, but it's a stalemate all the same.

"REPETITION OF MOVES!" the enemy rook calls out. They're right. It's odd--the whole affair seemed a draw, anyway, so why were they so eager to claim one? I guess they are eager to get back to oppressing pawns, or something.

Triumph! The pawn makes it to the eighth rank. There is a swirl of light before the white queen pops up.
The black rook sneaks to c4! You have nothing better to do than have your queen take the rook, which triggers stalemate.

The rook chuckles as it backpedals to d7. Your pawn is pinned against you. Even if you go to the eighth rank, the rook will take it the next move.

The rook chuckles as it swoops behind the pawn to c6. And you're too far away to even guard it! You will lose the war now.

The black rook slides over to c4, forking you and your pawn on c7. The rook and king endgame ahead will be painful.

The black king, trapped on the edge of the board, will die off soon enough. It's time to pillage a bit! You order your rook to smack up their opposing number, and they do so with relish.

Yes! Why not give the black rook a bit of false hope? Throw a check their way. The enemy king can't move too far. Sure, it would've been quicker to take the other rook, but sometimes, it's fun to play with your prey.

There are spite checks and then there are spite checks! Your rook slides all the way to the side. The black king moves, but you have no follow-up. The black rook zips to the side of the board, and you will be pushed away from the enemy king.
