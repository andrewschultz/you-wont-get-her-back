You haven't found any achievements, but don't worry. You'll get one soon. You Won't Get Her Back tracks both wins and losses. You'll find creative losses as you go.

The black rook slides over to c5, keeping an eye on the pawn, which can easily be taken before it is promoted. Fortuntaely, the enemy king can't help the rook corral the pawn for free.

The rook zips down to d1. So unfair! You have feet and legs and everything, and you're nowhere near that fast! But you see what's up. You'll be able to guard your pawn easily. Thankfully, the enemy king's too far away to gang up on your pawn, but it's a stalemate all the same.

"REPETITION OF MOVES!" the enemy rook calls out. They're right. It's odd--the whole affair seemed a draw, anyway, so why were they so eager to claim one? I guess they are eager to get back to oppressing pawns, or something.

Triumph! The pawn makes it to the eighth rank. It's too good to be true! Your queen is back. Surely she will be able to outmaneuver a mere rook?
The black rook seems unconcerned. It sneaks to c4! You and your queen are now both under attack, but she can just take it...right?

You recognize it will be stalemate if your wife captures the enemy rook. "Thus, I perish," you cry, adding how life isn't worth living without her, but ... it's not exactly what she'd have chosen as her final memory. She never asked for that melodramatic nonsense.
And of course, you realize this, too, as the enemy king and rook move in on you slowly.
In the afterlife, a low-ranking angel informs you that you'd have gotten to see her even if you hadn't died together, but she hasn't quite forgiven you yet, and what's more, she'll be allowed to move up from Limbo even without forgiving you. Ouch!

You freeze up. It's almost too good to be true, getting your wife back. And then, something too awful to be true: the black rook slides over to c4, forking you and your pawn on c7. The rook and king endgame ahead will be painful.

The black rook snickers as it slides over to c4. Your newly returned ally, the white bishop, will be captured next move, and a very unpleasant but inevitably lost rook endgame awaits.

Yes! Why not give the black rook a bit of false hope? Throw a check their way. The enemy king can't move too far. Sure, it would've been quicker to take the other rook, but sometimes, it's fun to play with your prey.

Of course, you could have had your rook do the taking. But you had a bit of unfinished business. You needed someone to beat up after being forced to get your rook and not your wife back. Your own rook understands, of course. The enemy king is forced out of the corner momentarily until you stuff him back in. It's a nice bit of petty revenge, especially since it doesn't get in the way of winning the war.

Your rook looks dismayed. The black rook seems surprised. "Take him and get it over with! I'm tired of this stupid war!" the king booms from the corner. The black rook and your rook protest. They'd like a good, long, boring draw, but your opposite number doesn't have time for that. The black rook sighs and does its duty.
All that work, and nothing to show for it all around.

The black rook and king breathe a collective sigh of relief as the black rook begins checking you vertically. You'll never be able to stay on a3 and b3 to keep the enemy king boxed in. It's going to be a draw. A long, fifty-move one, unless you agree to trade rooks. But even getting into position for that may be tiresome.
DEBUG: checking for staler than stalemate, mate achievement.
Congratulations! You just got the STALER THAN STALEMATE, MATE achievement!

A loud shout from behind: "what the heck are you doing? Are you TRYING to find ways to lose?"

You turn your head, and when you face forward, the black rook is staring at you, about to break down in laughter.

You felt a small wicked twinge for teasing the enemy rook and king a bit before going in for the kill.

A painful trip through memory lane. No, there was nothing you could have done. You had that clever idea, and it just wasn't enough.
You were feeling a bit sadstic, there. The enemy king meant to cause maximum pain, and now you're causing it back, dragging things out all the way. Serves him right.
Congratulations! You just got the DRAGGING IT OUT ALL THE WAY achievement!

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, UNDO the last command or see NOTES on the initial position?

>notes
The position at the start is known as the Saavedra position. Saavedra himself didn't create it. He just found a hole in the "black to draw" puzzle from the original position, by G. E. Barbier, who saw Rc4+! after the promotion to a queen but missed the underpromotion that would have rendered it harmless. The Wikipedia entry has more detail on the history, but I found it to be the simplest example of a legitimate surprise to be found in a chess game, where once you see it, it's obvious. And while one may wonder what the heck the black king is doing off in the corner, a lot of the themes come up elsewhere, and anyone who says this ruins the puzzle probably nitpicks cartoons for realism, too.
My own experience with this was back in my junior year of high school. I beat a gentleman named Slavko Milovanovic who was rated 2000 and may or may not have been sandbagging. But he was very nice about a loss to a considerably lower-rated player, and afterwards he showed me a bunch of neat stuff. This was the neatest and most memorable. It's one of the very top puzzles I try and pass on to people who may be interested in chess but don't want to devote an insane amount of time to opening theory, and I hope you enjoyed it, too.

And so it comes to pass: the enemy king, safe from the main action for so long, is trapped. He thought he was safe or, if you got close, he could get out of the corner quickly enough. Even being one square away from the corner would've been good enough! Well, he deserved his fate. You can't remember how or why he got there. You have your revenge, which is something, even if you will have to do without your queen.

Congratulations! You just got the DRAGGING IT OUT ALL THE WAY achievement!
[NOTE: I gave you the "dragging it out" achievement, too, for if you repeated any position at all and still won. But you found the maximum amount to repeat without a draw, so great job there!]
