You haven't found any achievements, but don't worry. You'll get one soon. You Don't Want Her Back tracks both wins and losses. You'll find creative losses as you go.

The black rook slides over to c5, keeping an eye on the pawn, which can easily be taken before it is promoted. Of course, the enemy king has no shot of corralling the pawn so the rook doesn't die in the process. Your hopes of winning are dashed!

The rook zips down to d1. So unfair! You have feet and legs and everything, and you're nowhere near that fast! But you see what's up. You'll be able to guard your pawn easily. Thankfully, the enemy king's too far away to gang up on your pawn, but it's a stalemate all the same.

"REPETITION OF MOVES!" the enemy rook calls out. They're right. It's odd--the whole affair seemed a draw, anyway, so why were they so eager to claim one? I guess they are eager to get back to oppressing pawns, or something.

Triumph! The pawn makes it to the eighth rank. There is a swirl of light before the white queen pops up.
The black rook sneaks to c4! You have nothing better to do than have your queen take the rook, which triggers stalemate.

Yes! Why not give the black rook a bit of false hope? Throw a check their way. The enemy king can't move too far. Sure, it would've been quicker to take the other rook, but sometimes, it's fun to play with your prey.

There are spite checks and then there are spite checks! Your rook slides all the way to the side. The black king moves, but you have no follow-up. The black rook zips to the side of the board, and you will be pushed away from the enemy king.

Well, since the black rook forced you to, why not? That doesn't stop the inevitable. In fact, it barely delays things. But it was fun, seeing your opponents grovel for a bit, in a way.

Your rook looks dismayed. The black rook seems surprised. "Take him and get it over with! I'm tired of this stupid war!" the king booms from the corner. The black rook and your rook protest. They'd like a good, long, boring draw, but your opposite number doesn't have time for that. The black rook sighs and does its duty.
All that work, and nothing to show for it all around.

The black rook and king breathe a collective sigh of relief as the black rook begins checking you vertically. You'll never be able to stay on a3 and b3 to keep the enemy king boxed in. It's going to be a draw. A long, fifty-move one, unless you agree to trade rooks. But even getting into position for that may be tiresome.

You turn your head, and when you face forward, the black rook is staring at you, about to break down in laughter.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, UNDO the last command or see NOTES on the initial position?

>notes
The position at the start is known as the Saaverda position. Saaverda himself didn't create it. He just found a hole in the "black to draw" puzzle from the original position, by G. E. Barbier, who saw Rc4+! after the promotion to a queen but missed the underpromotion. The Wikipedia entry has more detail on the history, but I found it to be the simplest example of a legitimate surprise to be found in a chess game, where once you see it, it's obvious. And while one may wonder what the heck the black king is doing off in the corner, a lot of the themes come up elsewhere, and anyone who says this ruins the puzzle probably nitpicks cartoons for realism, too.
My own experience with this was back in my junior year of high school. I beat a gentleman named Slavko Milovanovic who was rated 2000 and may or may not have been sandbagging. But he was very nice about a loss to a considerably lower-rated player, and afterwards he showed me a bunch of neat stuff. This was the neatest and most memorable. It's one of the very top puzzles I try and pass on to people who may be interested in chess but don't want to devote an insane amount of time to opening theory, and I hope you enjoyed it, too.
