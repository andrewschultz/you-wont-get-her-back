Triumph! The pawn makes it to the eighth rank. The black king laughs as the white bishop, and not your wife the white queen, pops up.
Congratulations! You just got the FORKED TO DEATH achievement!

The black rook scoffs as you call for a rook, not your queen. "Sheesh. If you wanted a draw, you could've repeated moves." He shuffles over to a4.

You can only promote to Q for queen, B for bishop, R for rook, or K/N for knight (since N could be confused with north, I want to leave that option open)

Triumph! The pawn makes it to the eighth rank. It's too good to be true! Your queen is back. Surely she will be able to outmaneuver a mere rook?

The black rook seems unconcerned. It sneaks to c4! You and your queen are now both under attack, but she can just take it...right?
