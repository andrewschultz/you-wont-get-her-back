This personalizes a chess endgame study where the player 1) tries to figure what's happening and 2) once they do, tries to figure ways to mess up. I hope it's fun.

The source is in Inform 7, with some support scripts in Python. It is build on the 6G60 (Windows) version of the IDE.

Test scripts are thanks to Zarf/Andrew Plotkin's regtest.py.
