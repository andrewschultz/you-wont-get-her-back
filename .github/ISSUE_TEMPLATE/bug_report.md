**Describe the bug**
Summarize the bug. Succinctness in the big picture is nice, but if a detail seems useful, don't leave it out. You never know what can tip someone off.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. type a set of commands, or "start in X"
2. this command doesn't seem to work
3. what is the suspicious text/formatting?

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. As above, if you have alternate suggestions for a good compromise in case your request is impractical, that can be a help, too.

**Screenshots**
Screenshots are valuable, but a transcript is even better, since it can be searched and it can tell me all the moves so far. If you're able to type TRANSCRIPT at any point and try again, great.

**Interpreter**
Glulxe? Git? Spatterlight? Or even on the Web?
The OS may be important, especially for font issues.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here. Transcripts can be attached (use TRANSCRIPT to start one) ... don't worry about annotating them, as I may be able to see something isn't the way I wanted it. Even noting you can't produce the bug directly is helpful. Also, having a chunk of text around the error can point me to game text in my code where bad things may be happening.
