# Python utilities directory for You Won't Get Her Back

* che.py creates an 8x8 set of rooms in Inform, with xval and yval
* p2t.py takes one ZarfScript and reorganizes it to use a test command instead of the longer player input. Unfortunately, the new script doesn't save that much time, so I kept the old file.
